    <p> All body text should be rendered at a size of 10pts, in the Verdana font (if possible),
      <br> and with the color black and 14 points between lines.  If the user does not have the<br>
      Verdana font installed, the list of fonts in the style sheet represents the order in which<br>the browser
      should search for fonts to use: Geneva, then Arial, then Helvetica.
      If the<br> user has none of those fonts, the browser will use whatever default sans-serif font is<br>
      available. Additionally, the page should have left, right, and top margins of 5 points.)</p>

    If the user does not have the Verdana font installed,
    the list of fonts in the<br> style sheet will represent the order in which the browser
    should search for fonts to<br> use: Geneva, then Arial, then Helvetica.
    If the user has none of those fonts, the<br>browser will use whatever default sans-serif font is available.</p>

    there will be a 3 point space around the image. The images on the web<br> page will also be moved
    to the right side of the page.</p>
</div>
<div id="def"><h2 style="text-decoration:underline">a</h2>

<div id="def"><h2 style="text-decoration:underline"><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" /> linking style sheet </h2>
  <p>With this line of code, the user is able to link their css file into their html file. This<br>is convenient
    because rather than having to do the css on the same html file,<br>one can have two separate files and then combine them.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="def"><h2 style="text-decoration:underline"><img src="logo.gif" alt="BAWSI LOGO" title=”This is Bawsi’s Logo”/>insert image</h2>
